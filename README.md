Maker Square assignment

Objective: build a Javascript front-end to interface with a remote API.

TO DO 
  - Waiting on server-side fix for problem with getting all chats 'since'
    - Will allow for "real-time" updates
  - Need to handle sign-up errors (e.g. - when username already exists)
  - Same with sign-in errors
  - Could do more with the slider menu.  Just displays username right now.
    - Could integrate it with the interface code.
  - Display images from chats
