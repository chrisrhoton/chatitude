Maker Square assignment

Objective: build a Javascript front-end to interface with a remote API.

TO DO 
  - Waiting on server-side fix for problem with getting all chats 'since'
    - Will allow for "real-time" updates.  **Interim Solution**: Refreshing all chats every second.
  - ~~Need to handle sign-up errors (e.g. - when username already exists)~~
    - **Done** - at least the first implementation.  Could be improved.
  - ~~Same with sign-in errors~~
    - **Done** - a bit of a hack.  Could be improved.
  - Could do more with the slider menu.  Just displays username right now.
    - Could integrate it with the interface code.
  - Display images from chats
